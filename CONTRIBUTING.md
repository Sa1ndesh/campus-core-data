   ```

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We use the following conventions:

- **TypeScript**: All new code should be written in TypeScript
- **Components**: Use functional components with hooks
- **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Naming**: Use PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions and variables
- **File Structure**: Keep components small and focused

### Component Guidelines

```typescript
// Good: Small, focused component
const StudentCard = ({ student }: { student: Student }) => {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 border rounded-lg">
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">{student.name}</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600">{student.email}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

// Avoid: Large, complex components
// Break them down into smaller, reusable pieces
```

### State Management

- Use React Query for server state
- Use React hooks for local component state
- Keep state as close to where it's used as possible

### Styling Guidelines

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow the existing design system
- Ensure responsive design (mobile-first approach)
- Use shadcn/ui components when possible
